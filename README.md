### Hi there 👋

I'm Raghukarn Sharma, a healthcare analytics pro with a knack for data and a passion for problem-solving. I hold a Master's in Computer Science and have a solid background in data engineering and machine learning. From turbocharging reports at Tata Consultancy Services to coaching clients at Cognizant Technology Solutions, I've honed my skills in data analysis and modeling and I love turning data into insights.
Beyond data, I advocate for student mental health, serve as a clinical POC for oncology, and lead outdoor treks. Let's connect and explore the exciting world of healthcare analytics together!
